# Stock Trading with Deep Q-Network (DQN)

This project implements a **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** reinforcement learning agent to trade stocks based on three technical analysis features:

- **Close** â€” Closing price of the stock
- **BB_upper** â€” Upper Bollinger Band
- **BB_lower** â€” Lower Bollinger Band

The system is built in a **Jupyter Notebook** environment, allowing you to explore, train, and evaluate the trading agent interactively.

## Project Features

- ðŸ“ˆ **Reinforcement Learning** â€” Uses a DQN to learn trading strategies from historical price data.
- ðŸ“Š **Technical Indicators** â€” Bollinger Bands are calculated and used as input features.
- ðŸ›  **Training & Testing** â€” Includes both model training and evaluation/testing routines.
- ðŸ’¾ **Model Saving** â€” Saves model checkpoints during training for recovery or reuse.
- ðŸ““ **Interactive Exploration** â€” All workflows are in a Jupyter Notebook for transparency and experimentation.

## Environment Setup

1. **Create and activate the Conda environment:**

```bash
conda create --name und-ai-trading-strategies-p3 python=3.10
conda activate und-ai-trading-strategies-p3
```

2. **Install required packeages:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Project
1. **Launch Jupyter Lab**

```bash
jupyter lab
```

2. **Open Notebook**
```bash
project_nb.ipynb
```

3. **Train the model**

Run the training cells â€” the agent will:
 * Observe the stock price and Bollinger Band features.
 * Decide when to buy, sell, or hold.
 * Update its strategy using experience replay.

4. **Test the model**
After training, run the testing section to:
 * Evaluate the model on unseen data.
 * Plot buy/sell actions against the true stock prices.
 * Report total profit, number of winning trades, and losses.
