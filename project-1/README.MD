# Data Analysis Preparation Project

This project is a Jupyter Notebook-based environment designed to help students prepare for real-world data analysis tasks. It includes Python functions, helper scripts, and a sample notebook (`Preparing-for-data-analysis-project-student.ipynb`) to walk through exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, and other foundational techniques.

## Project Features

- Jupyter Notebook interface for hands-on learning
- Utility functions in `func_lib.py` for data transformation and visualization
- Requirements file for dependency management
- Easy setup via Conda

## Environment Setup

1. **Create and activate the Conda environment:**

```bash
conda create --name und-ai-trading-strategies-p1 python=3.10
conda activate und-ai-trading-strategies-p1
```

2. **Install required packeages:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Launching Jupyter Lab
Once the environment is ready, start Jupyter Lab:
```bash
jupyter lab
```

Then open `Preparing-for-data-analysis-project-student.ipynb` to begin. For any additional utility functions, refer to `func_lib.py`.
